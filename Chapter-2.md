# Chapter 2 - Summarizing and Graphing Data

## 2-1 Review and Preview
---

1. Characteristics of Data
  1. **Center:** A representative value that indicates where the middle if the data set is located.
  2. **Variation:** A measure of the amount that the data values vary.
  3. **Distribution:** The nature or shape of the spread of the data over the range of values (such as bell-shaped).
  4. **Outliers:** Sample values that lie very far away from the vast majority of the other sample values.
  5. **Time:** Any change in the characteristics of the data over time.

> **A frequency distribution** - shows how data are partitioned among several categories (or classes) by listing the categories along with the number (frequency) of data values in each of them.

## 2-2 Frequency Distributions

**Table 2-2**
---

| IQ Score | Frequency |
| -------- | --------- |
| 50-69    | 2         |
| 70-89    | 33        |
| 90-109   | 35        |
| 110-129  | 7         |
| 130-149  | 1         |

> **Lower class limits** - are the smallest numbers that can belong to the different classes. (Table 2-2 has lower class limits of 50,70,90,110, and 130)

---

> **Upper class limits** - are the largest numbers that can belong to the different classes. (Table 2-2 has upper class limits of 69, 89, 109, 129, and 149.)

---

> **Class boundaries** - are the numbers used to separate the classes, but without the gaps created by class limits.  Figure 2-1 shows the gaps created by the class limits from Table 2-2.  In Figure 2-1 we see that the values of 69.5, 89.5, 109.5, and 129.5 are in the centers of those gaps, and following the pattern of those class boundaries, we see that the lowest class boundary is 49.5 and the highest class boundary is 149.5.  Thus the complete list of class boundaries is 49.5, 69.5, 89.5, 109.5, 129.5, and 149.5.

---

> **Class midpoints** - are the values in the middle of the classes.  Table 2-2 has class midpoints of 59.5, 79.5, 99.5, 119.5, and 139.5.  Each class midpoint is computed by adding the lower class limit to the upper class limit and dividing the sum by 2.

---

> **Class width** - is the difference between two consecutive lower class limits (or two consecutive lower class boundaries) in a frequency distribution.  Table 2-2 uses a class width of 20.

### Procedure for constructing a Frequency Distribution

---

1. Select the number of classes, usually between 5 and 20.  The number of classes might be affected by the convenience of using round numbers,

2. Calculate the class width.  Class width = (maximum data value) - (minimum data value) / number of classes  Round this result to get a convenient number. (It's usually best to round up)  Using a specific number of classes is not too important, and it's usually wise to change the number of classes so that they use convenient values for the class limits.

3. Choose the value for the first lower class limit by using either the minimum value or a convenient value below the minimum.

4. Using the first lower class limit and the class width, list the other lower class limits. (Add the class width to the first lower class limit to get the second lower class limit.  Add the class width to the second lower class limit to get the third lower class limit, and so on.)

5. List the lower class limits in a vertical column and then determine and enter the upper class limits.

6. Take each individual data value and put a tally mark in the appropriate class.  Add the tally marks to find the total frequency for each class.

### Relative Frequency Distribution

---

Relative frequency distribution or percentage frequency distribution is when each class frequency is replaced by a relative frequency or a percentage.

Relative frequency for a class = frequency for a class / sum of all frequencies

Percentage for a class = frequency for a class / sum of all frequencies * 100%

> The sum if the percentage in a relative frequency distribution must be very close to 100%.

---

### Cumulative Frequency Distribution

---

> Cumulative Frequency Distribution - in which the frequency for each class is the sum of the frequencies for that class and all previous classes

---

### Normal Distribution

---

1. The frequencies start low, then increase to one or two high frequencies, and then decrease to a low frequency.

2. The distribution is approximately symmetric, with frequencies preceding the maximum being roughly a mirror image of the that follow the maximum.

## 2-3 Histograms

---

> A histogram - is a graph consisting of bars of equal width drawn adjacent to each other (unless there are gaps in the data).  The horizontal scale represents classes of quantitative data values and the vertical scale represents frequencies.  The heights of the bars correspond to the frequency values.

---

> A relative frequency histogram has the same shape and horizontal scale as a histogram, but the vertical scale uses relative frequencies (as percentages or proportions) instead of actual frequencies.

---

### Normal Distribution

---

A histogram that has a bell shaped curve has normal distribution.

### Common Distribution Shapes

---

1. Skewed to the right or the left
