# Chapter 1 - Introduction to Statistics

## 1-1 Review and Preview
---

1. Two major flaws in surveys
  * Misleading graphs
        * Graphs that don't start a zero
  * Bad sampling
        * Surveys that are voluntary response. eg web page
          Correct way is random sampling.

> **Data** - are collections of observations, such as measurements, genders, or survey responses.
> (A single data value is called a datum, a term that does not see very much use.)

---

> **Statistics** - is the science of planning studies and experiments; obtaining data; and then organizing.
> Summarizing, presenting, analyzing, and interpreting those data and then drawing conclusions based on them.

---

> **A Population** - is the complete collection of all measurements or data that are being considered.

---

> **A Sample** - is a subcollection of members selected fron a population.
> It's common to use a sample to form a conclusion about the population.


## 1-2 Statistical and Critical Thinking
---

### Prepare

1. Context
  * What does the data mean?
  * What is the goal of the study?

2. Source of the data
  * Are the data from a source with a special interest so that there is pressure to obtain results that are favorable to the source?

3. Sampling Method
  * Were the data collected in a way that is unbiased, or were the data collected in a way that is biased (such as procedure in which respondents volunteer to participate)?

### Analyze

1. Graph the Data

2. Explore the Data
  * Are there any outliers (numbers very far away from almost all of the other data)?
  * What important statistics summarize the data (such as the mean and standard deviation described in later)?
  * How are the data distributed?
  * Are there missing data?
  * Did many selected subjects refuse to respond

3. Apply Statistical Methods
  * Use Technology to obtain results.

### Conclude

1. Statistical Significance
  * Do the results have statistical significance?
  * Do the results have practical significance?

> **A Voluntary Response Sample** - is one which the respondents themeselves decide whether to be included.

### Potential Pitfalls

1. Misleading Conclusions
2. Reported Results
3. Small Samples
4. Loaded Questions
5. Order of Questions
6. Nonresponse
7. Missing Data
8. Precise Numbers
9. Precentages

## 1-3 Types of Data
---

> **A parameter** - is a numerical measurement describing some characteristic of a population.

---

> **A statistic** - is a numerical measurement describing some characteristic of a sample.

---

> **Quantitative Data** - consist of numbers representing counts or measurements.

---

> **Categorical Data** - consist of names or lables that are not numbers representing counts or measurements.

---

> **Discrete Data** - result when the data values are quantitative and the number of values is finite or "countable."(If there are infinitely many values, the collection of values is countable if it is possible to count them individually, such as the number of tosses of a coin before getting tails.)

---

> **Continuous data** - result from infinitely many possible quantitative values, where the collection of values is not countable. (That is, it is impossible to count the individual items because at least some of them are on a continuous scale, such as the lengths from 0cm to 12cm.)

### Discrete/Continuous

  * **Discrete Data of the Finite Type:** The numbers of eggs that hens lay in one week are ***discrete*** data because they are finite numbers, such as 5 and 7 that result from a counting process.

  * **Discrete Data of the infinite Type:** Consider the number of rolls of a die required to get an outcome of 2.  It is possible that you could roll a die forever without ever getting a 2, but you can still count the number of rolls as you proceed.  The collection of rolls is countable, because you can count them, even though you might go on counting forever.

  * **Countinuous Data:** During a year, a cow might yield an amount if milk that can be any value between 0 liters and 7000 liters, but it is impossible to count the number of different possible values on such a continuous scale.

### Levels of measurement

  * **Ordinal data** – can be ordered from highest to lowest (rankings)
  * **Nominal data** – categories that cannot be ordered (favorite TV shows)
  * **Interval  data** – ordered and the difference in values mean something (temperatures)
  * **Ratio data** – ratios of results mean something and there is a natural zero (“twice as long”)

## 1-4 Collecting Sample Data
---

### Data collection must be done carefully!!

### Types of data collection
  * **Observational studies** – someone or something watching subjects and recording data
  * **Experimental studies** – applying a treatment to a subject and looking at effects (before   and after)
  * **Random sampling** – each member of the population has an equal chance of being chosen, can be done through various techniques (IST majors should be familiar with random number generators)
  * **Systematic sampling** – count off method of using every nth item (done in manufacturing on an assembly line to test quality)
  * **Convenience sampling** – you know those people who try to stop you in the mall to ask a few questions…
  * **Stratified sampling** – splitting the population up first and then making sure you get representation from each group (males/females, age groups)
  * **Cluster sampling** – randomly pick groups and then use every one in that group (testing a carton of eggs)
